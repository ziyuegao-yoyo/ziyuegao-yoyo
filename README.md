- 👋 Hi, I’m @ziyuegao-yoyo. You can call me gao, or yoyo. Yeah, “yoyo” is the “yoyo” of yoyo-ball, although I am not good at it, but I just love it so much.
- 👀 I’m interested in using first-principles calculation and non-traditional isotope to understand the geological systems, especially metallogenic system.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, GROMACS, LAMMPS and French.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on comprehensive studies of DFT, molecular dynamic simulation, isotope and ore deposits.
- 📫 How to reach me : E-mail: ziyuegao.geo@qq.com
